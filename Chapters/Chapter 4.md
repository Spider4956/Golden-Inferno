# Chapter Four

The monsters unfortunately seemed to be in a large abundance and the team didn't stop getting swarmed. The low-level beasts lacked barely any intelligence and were clearly driven by hunger and primitive instincts yet what they had strength in were their numbers. Not even a few minutes in and Zenon was already dripping in blue blood, it was covering him quicker than it evaporated and his eyes shone through them filled with malice. It was clear he was not fighting comfortably and the result was a look akin to a juggernaut mid-fight. It was one that unnerved Winston. He had stayed back and decided to let the two in front of him do the work but he felt kind of bad for them despite being terrified of them. Noticing an opening, sparing a moment's hesitation the lad rushed forward trying to impale the creature with a spear although he didn't have enough force to actually cut through. Instead, he pushed the beast out of the path of Zenon whose speed caught Winston off-guard. Inadvertently, the white-haired elusive figure would be left wide open. He tried to move although not enough of his body was in contact with the ground causing the demon to get a hit on his side, leaving scratch marks as he grit his teeth.

“You fucktard.” He growled although it wasn't clear who he meant as he pivoted on his landing and slammed his fist into the monster's head, taking it clean off. He then turned to Winston, his eyes gleaming, “Don't get in my way again you useless invertebrate.” This caused Winston to reel back slightly in shock and hurt, he really didn't like people telling him off, even if they had a very small connection to him.

“M-my bad.” He replied, backing away with his hands up.

“That was uncalled for.” Bianca berated a smoking lapiz-skinned Zenon. “You realise if we want to survive here we ALL have to get along together.” She walked up to the boy who didn't seem to care what she was saying and pressed a finger in his chest trying to hide her surprise at its rigidness, “Winston is trying to help. He may be weaker but he's pure of heart and your shitty life sucks attitude doesn't need to rub off on him.” She scowled, walking away not even giving Zenon a chance to reply. He simply flicked some blood off himself and glanced into the distance.
“Please just leave me alone.” He muttered to no one.

Another couple of metres travelled, another horde. Zenon took charge once again and cleared most of them easily.

A day had passed and after travelling together they seemed to have grown closer. After all, 24 hours is a long time. Well, they weren’t exactly best friends but an hour of silence can get awkward so Bianca and Winston mostly talked about things with Zenon occasionally chipping in. It was nice. Sort of. It was somewhat dysfunctional but also nice in its weird way. Eventually, Zenon - with his seemingly more adept hearing - heard noise. A loud noise of what seemed to be metal on metal. “Hold on.” He said waving to the others as he listened and looked as far as he could, it looked like the land fell away at some point which he could only assume was the origin of the noise. This was further confirmed by the wisps of smoke rising out of the edge. “There’s definitely something there, we haven’t been travelling long enough to reach Alchante have we?” He asked Bianca who shook her head in response. 

“Definitely not, we should still have at least a day.” 

“I guess…we go around it?” Winston suggested helpfully to which Zenon and Bianca said “No!” simultaneously. “Oh look at you guys, you’ve gotten closer.” Which caused them to eye each other before taking a step away from one another. 

“No, I still don’t trust that-”

“WELL let’s check out the pit,” Winston said trying to relieve the tension before he’d have to separate them from each other's throats, or well try to since he clearly knew he was inferior to the two monsters in front of him. “We may not know what is down there but if there’s something this massive then we probably don’t wanna go around the outside in case we cross someone even worse scouting out the area. Maybe even an entire army surrounding the place so we might as well go straight through the middle.” Bianca and Zenon just stared at him.

“Wow, Winston.” Bianca gave a slow clap. “Never thought you could think that well. Guess I should give you more credit.” She reached into her pocket and drew out what seemed to be pipes folded in on each other with a piece of string holding it together. “Let’s go then!”

The group approached the edge of the pit peeking over. Oddly enough, the surrounding area was devoid of life and they had no issue getting in close. The sight before them was definitely one to behold. Clumps of shiny metals in the centre, surrounded by odd figures with horns who seemed to be harvesting it. A huge pit of fire. 

“Looks like a mining operation but those are no humans.” Zenon muttered, “Even weirder, they’re wearing…protective gear?”

“We have to shut it down. Whatever it is, they’re never up to any good.” Bianca replied.

“Better to keep things quiet. I'll go in and see what information I can get without forcing a fight.” Zenon nodded to Bianca before drawing his katana and dropping down into the pit landing on a demon walking a cart on the top layer. He landed on its shoulders simultaneously driving the blade into its head so it looked like Frankenstein’s monster. Then, he disappeared out of view.

“How long do you think he's going to take?” Winston moaned as he cautiously spun his spear, it was clear he hadn't exactly mastered the weapon with his lack of confidence. Bianca shrugged and continued stacking rocks like she had earlier.

“He might be dead. Wouldn't exactly be a shame though if he was. We don’t need him and he doesn’t need us.”

Winston shuffled to the edge and looked down, it seemed like activity had completely disappeared on the side closest to them but he could still faintly hear movement from the other side. “Could I have a try at that? Stacking I mean.”
“Get your own rocks.”

“They're all down there.”

Bianca rolled her eyes and chucked Winston a rock from behind her back which he almost dropped. 

“Boom caught it.” He boasted as he swung his legs into a cross. Unfortunately, this caused him to kick Bianca's pile of rocks into the pits which would have been fine if they hadn't all slammed into a cart filled with metals. Now this wouldn't have been a problem if the cart didn't decide to tip all those metals and come crashing down creating a sort of chain reaction and a sound loud enough for _everyone_ to hear. “Er, oops?”

“You're a fucking idiot, Winston,” Bianca growled very frustrated as she unfolded her metal pipes into what became a bow and slid down the side of the pit into it. Winston tumbled behind her. “Now everyone knows we're here. We have to get Zenon and leave.”

“Do you-” Winston panted, breathless “Care for him?”

“No, if he dies we all fail.” She started moving and Winston waved a hand for her to slow down as demons flooded out from below. Rapidly climbing to the two.

“Bianca, on your left!” Winston called out as she swung round and shot an arrow, point blank into the demon's head causing it to stagger. She ducked down from its flailing hands and swiped out a dagger, slamming it into the demon's neck before kicking it down into the depths. More and more were coming though Winston couldn't dispose of them as easily as Bianca. He ended up in a tussle and he and the demon ended up tumbling onto the metal, “OW.” He called out although his shout was immediately muddled by the demon who shrieked out as it dissolved. Even the ones who surrounded him were not going any closer.

“Winston, you genius!” Bianca called out as she started picking off the demons, “This metal, it must be their weakness.” Winston grinned and rubbed his spear on the metal before lunging and stabbing one of the demons causing it to reel back and die. 

“Let's go!” Winston cheered as he and Bianca worked together effectively clearing the crowd as they worked their way down. Eventually, they made it to Zenon who had also just dispatched his last demon, blood covered him and he was panting heavily as sweat poured down his face. His hair partially covered his eyes although looking at them it was easy to tell her was tired.

“I see you decided to join in.” He said to them as he took deep breaths to get his breathing and blood flow under control.

“Yeah…Winston discovered their weakness! It's the metal.”

“Yeah, I already know. Gallion. Already found that out from what seemed to be a talking demon. A supervisor essentially. I was going to get more information from it until the stupid alarm went off.” He shook his head. The blood that covered him seemed to have slowly disappeared from him. “There's another floor below, like a labyrinth of some sort. It would be better to stick together. That way I can keep track of you.” He said bluntly.

“Look, I'm not some dog you have to watch, I know I'm weak but-” Winston began mumbling and he looked to Bianca for help but she shook her head. “I found the demon's weakness, this could-”

“You and every other hunter in this world. Did you not pause to think about why demons were mining their weaknesses?” Zenon said slightly annoyed and Bianca's face dropped as it clicked in her head.

“No way. It shouldn't work.” She had a very serious look on her face, “Where's the mine entrance Zenon? We have got to stop whatever they're planning.”

“I don’t need you guys to join me. You’re just dead-weight, I’ll move faster on my own.” He replied rather harshly giving Bianca a weird look.

“I don’t give a fuck Zenon, I’m not sitting outside with Winston for an entire day or whatever.” She stepped up to him staring directly into the ocean on either side of his nose. “We are coming, whether you like it or not you cocky bastard.”
