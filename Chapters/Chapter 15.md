Winston and Bianca were panting by the end of the day as neither had fallen. Bianca however seemed in the worse state as she couldn’t take as many hits as Winston. Luna decided to call it a stalemate and they both went home, bruised yet in high spirits. Without hesitation, Winston would collapse on his mat, absolutely exhausted when they got a knock on the door. Seeing that Winston was not going to even bother getting up, Bianca walked over and opened it, seeing a fairly recognisable woman with a tall bald man next to her. They both had the Squad 2 patch on their right shoulder.

“Good evening!” The woman would beam, “Sorry to disturb you but we saw your training earlier and just wanted to say to keep it up.” 

“YEAH, YOU’LL DEFINITELY MAKE A FINE ADDITION TO SQUAD 2!” The man said loudly, causing Bianca to put her hands over her ears momentarily.

“Er, thanks?” She said looking slightly confused, not really sure what to say to the sudden interruption.

“YOU’RE WELCOME, NOW COME AND MEET THE TEAM!” He laughed as he jumped away giddy whilst the woman gave a nervous smile.

“Yeah that’s Katamu, he’s quite the character. What he’s trying to say is there’s a drinking party and you both are invited!” 

“Sorry, but we can’t aaargh,” Winston would say having gotten up and walked to the door before getting stamped on by Bianca.

“We’d love to go, thank you.” She said with a smile before dragging Winston out of the house.

The main dining hut of the team wasn’t overly impressive although it was rather big with long tables stretching from each side of the room to the other. It was quite loud and busy and it seemed like a ton of people were already enjoying themselves. It was weird but Bianca just noticed that she didn’t actually feel hungry. Neither she nor Winston had actually eaten since they entered Alchante. Definitely something she’d ask about when she had the chance. She broke out of her thoughts as she noticed a table with the trainees sitting quietly among themselves although she felt the woman drag them to the main table with the main team where there were cushions for them to sit on. They got a few weird looks from others although most of the table greeted them excitedly. 

“My name is Aura by the way.” The woman would introduce herself, her hand on her chest.

“Nice to meet you, I’m Bianca and this is Winston.”


“Make sure to drink as much as you can handle. We have enough to go around. Captain Archon is quite the alcoholic despite never admitting it although you can barely tell since he is the definition of a heavyweight, in more ways than one.”

“Speaking of, do you know where he is?” Bianca would ask, glancing down the table to an empty seat right at the tip.” Aura would shake her head with a slight frown.

“No, it’s pretty weird for him of all people to miss a drinking party, he must be really busy.” Aura glanced at Luna who seemed to be very red in the face, “Lieutenant Luna would know but I don’t think she’s able to answer that at the moment.” She shook her head with a grin, “She’s a lightweight but she always tries to surpass Captain Archon at these events. A futile attempt unfortunately for her.”

“You do realise we aren’t old enough to drink.” Winston would hiss in Bianca’s ear.

“What’s wrong, mummy going to tell you off?” Bianca teased, poking his face before taking a cup of Saké to which Winston bit his tongue, holding back the most devious reply ever. Instead, he picked up the cup in front of him, taking a sip before convoluting his face.

“Ew, this tastes so bitter it’s horrible.” He said, placing the cup down, to which Bianca gleefully snatched. “Slow down oh my gosh, you’re going to have the worst headache tomorrow.”

“Oh my gosh, my head hurts.” Bianca groaned, grasping her head as she got up from her mat. “I wonder what could have caused it.” She murmured as Winston slapped his face in disbelief.

“I truly wonder. Can’t relate.” Winston would point and laugh with a smug face as he waited for Bianca to get ready before they left to go to the headquarters. “What a beautiful day to be alive.” He jeered looking at Bianca who was barely putting two together.
“Shut up you’re so loud.” She said her eyes half open. “Screw this, I'm going back to bed.” She turned around but got stopped by Winston grabbing her collar and basically yanking her to class. 
As they reached the building, they noticed an unusual bustle of movement from the squad. 

“Unfortunately there won’t be any classes today!” A panicked Luna would say, briefly stopping to speak to Bianca and Winston, “Take the day off.” She hurried off not pausing to explain as a swarm of people moved with her. Captain Archon was nowhere to be seen though. 
Seeing as they wouldn’t be getting much of an explanation of what was going on, Bianca and Winston decided now would be the best time to explore Alchante. Stopping by their house to pick up a rolled map that Archon had left, they would hover over it taking a look at where to go. 

“Let me hold the map.” Bianca would order Winston who shook his head, “I literally lead us here, what do you mean?” She said tugging at the corner.

“Nah trust me, I know how to use it, let’s go to the library!” He ran off causing Bianca to in a sense slump after him. She was definitely feeling the effects of last night. 

“This is not the library.” Winston would say with a defeated look as he stared at a dead end. The white wall with brown tiles along the top mockingly stood there as Winston started frantically rotating the map around. “Ok, so we may or may not be lost.” 

“Even my drunk ass could have gotten us to something as big as a library. Give me.” She said to which Winston defeatedly accepted before Bianca paused, “We have no idea where we are.”

Well on the bright side, wandering around helped give them a better idea of the city within the walls. It was very traditional yet reinforced with a labyrinth of streets and old-fashioned homes. Each Section had a very clear area of the city with very clear themes separating each. The one thing that shocked them was the level of access granted to each area with what seemed to be a laboratory being one of the hardest places to enter. That is alongside a 6-storey mansion with locked tunnel entrances. From the surface, it looked inactive and unwelcoming although that was most definitely not the case.

“Black Ops.” A voice would say from behind them, causing them to leap in the air as they saw Aura basically appear from nowhere. “Sorry for scaring you,” She smiled wryly, “That building there is where the Black Operations of the Royal Guards take place. The mansion is a front and the reality of their headquarters is that they’re in an entire tunnel system underneath ALL of Alchante.” She shook her head, “The only people in that section are either stupidly talented or psychopathic weirdos. Just be glad you aren’t over there.”

“Thanks for the heads up.” Winston would say scratching his head as he tried to picture what a Black Ops member might look like, he could not hold back the slight chuckle as his imagination did not fail him. 

“Why aren’t you with the rest of Squad 2?” Bianca questioned, “We saw them hurrying somewhere.” 

“Ah very astute question, I’m not allowed on B-rank missions and above in case I don’t make it, I am one of the few in a non-healer section who can heal so they sort of coddle me when it comes to these things.” She shrugged, “I’m used to it. Better than transferring out to a ton of pacifists.” 

“What, is everyone in Squad 2 blood-hungry?” Winston joked.

“Not as much as Black Ops.” She curtly responded.
