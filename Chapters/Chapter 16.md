# Chapter 16

Black Holes were a phenomenon that absorbed anything and everything around them. They could not be stopped and it’s common thought that ‘The Great Attractor’ is a deep void that has evolved past the general image of a black hole. They come as a direct result of a star going supernova and releasing an extreme amount of energy before collapsing in on itself. Both were things that could annihilate anything with no effort yet Zenon found himself in between both of them at the same time. Surprisingly enough, he didn’t feel himself getting crushed by the gravity of either of them but they were there, he could hear them. In fact, it seemed like he was floating in space. Zenon awkwardly twisted around in place, annoyed he didn’t know how to fly yet. That was when he noticed he wasn’t alone. A man with a long cloak stood there. His shoulders were covered with black leaves and he had blonde hair to complete the look. His eyes were blue with red pupils and he had very defined veins underneath them. 

“Nico Zenon Datenshi. I wondered when you would pay me a visit.” The man would speak, his voice a somewhat harsh tone yet it sounded wise, like it had endured many things. 

“Greetings old man.” Nico would say, raising his hand up. “I must say that this is a rather nice place you have here.”

“It’s a representation of your soul so it’s rather good if you find it nice.” The man said as he started walking towards Nico. “My name is [~~~~~].”

“Pardon?” Nico asked, tilting his head, “I didn’t catch that.”

“What do you mean?” The man said looking confused before something seemed to click in his head. “Ah, I see.”

“See what?”

“Don’t worry.” He cleared his throat, “My name is Kami. I know you’re here for your magic.”

“Correct, will you give it to me?”

“...Nah.” 


Nico panted as he dodged another meteor thrown at him. 

“You have got to be taking the piss.” He spat as he spun around before vaulting off another incoming space rock. “I’m guessing at least my powers are space-related?”

“Nah. These aren’t even related, to be honest.” Kami swayed his arm, electricity crackling around it. “This is your true power when you prove yourself worthy of wielding it.” He appeared behind Nico. “If you need it, you’ll get it.” He punched a hole through Nico’s chest. “There are many things that I hate in this world but the number one thing is Solar Winds. Remember that, Nico.”

“ARGH WHAT A PRICK,” Zenon yelled as he pulled against the chains causing Archon to look up surprised. 

“I’m guessing he didn’t help you?”

“He didn’t tell me shit.” Zenon struggled against the chains although Archon remained unfazed. “When can I get out of these fucking things.”

“Patience, Zenon. It will be soon, trust me. I’m currently talking to Squad 1’s Captain.” Archon tried to reassure Zenon, “She’s lovely but a lot of her Anchisukiru’s are oddheads. Better than being executed.” He sighed as Zenon gave the chains slack once more. “Zenon, most of the Royal Guard officials want you dead. We had a Captain’s meeting. Eradicate all demons they said.” He chuckled slightly, “We’re trying to play the long game here. Trust me, you don’t want to go out there.”


The door opened and a woman fully wrapped in black cloth stepped in soundlessly. She was a crossover of a ninja and a mummy and the only thing visible was her eyes and the bridge of her nose which almost blended in with her clothes. As she walked over, she would pull the bands from her face causing her Green hair to float down and rest on her shoulders, a stray wisp dangling over her left eye. She walked across the black room looking down at Zenon in what only seemed to be a physical way. He could see in her eyes that she didn’t see him as something to put down although he didn’t exactly like the other option. 

“Ah, my weapon!” She would hold her arms behind her back before swinging down tilting her head as she looked Zenon in the eyes. The boy would glance at Archon who mouthed ‘Good Luck’ to Zenon before he walked out pulling his hat over his eyes and giggling to himself. The woman tilted Zenon’s chin to face her, leaning in extremely close, he could feel her breath on his cheeks and he flushed a deep red as he resisted the urge to say mommy to her. Taking a big gulp he attempted to speak but she put a finger on his lips silencing him. “Shhh. Don’t speak,” She rested her other hand on his head, her purple eyes piercing into his soul. “I know all about you Zenon,” She leaned in closer, “You know you and I aren’t so different. Raised to be an assassin as a child?” She giggled slightly, “Methinks you’ll make a perfect addition to Black Ops.” His sapphire eyes tried to look somewhere else but it felt like he was trapped looking at her. “Will you be a good boy for me?”

“Yes ma’am.” He replied, his throat incredibly dry. 

“Good.” She smiled, patting his head before standing up and spinning on her heel. “I am Captain Kelila but you can call me other things. You’ll be out of those chains soon enough unless you prefer them.” She winked before leaving. Zenon was just left there staring into the distance, his mind trying to comprehend whatever the heck that was. He truly hoped the rest of the people he’d be with weren’t similar.

“Now,” Luna began, “You’ll eventually reach a stage where you can constantly keep a flow of mana around your body acting as armour in a sense. Of course, it is not indestructible however, it is useful. Especially against small pests seeing as they won’t be able to injure you with basic attacks. Many creatures have to learn mana effectively so you’ll have an advantage over many creatures apart from demons. They know how to use it instinctively, well more so they know how to use Magika which is a reversal of conventional mana. That’s why we have many other things to help beat them.” She raised an eyebrow as Winston raised his hand, “Yes?”

“What is that white air coming off you?” He asked to which she’d smile. 

“My mana. Seems like we have a change of plan since you mentioned that!”

The trainees each stood in front of a fully-fledged member of Section 2. Funnily enough, Winston stood in front of Katamu while Bianca stood in front of Aura. Aura gave Bianca a warm smile whilst Katamu gave Winston a sort of penetrating and fierce look causing the boy to shrink back in worry for his personal safety.

“Well, this one is simple! Beat your opponent to an extent that they are satisfied with and you graduate into the next class!” Luna would clap her hands together in an innocent grin whilst Winston turned to look at her with absolute horror on his face.

“Looks like she’s taking a sadistic leaf out of Captain Archon’s book.” Aura would laugh nervously. 

“Poor Winston is going to get minced,” Bianca muttered.

“So are you.” Aura replied, “I’m a healer but.”

“WHAT THE FUCK.” Bianca shouted as she dodged another one of Aura’s blows. She was already bleeding from the side of her stomach after the first blow landing at the start of their fight. “I THINK YOU AREN’T ALLOWED ON THOSE MISSIONS TO PROTECT THE OPPONENTS!” Bianca exclaimed, worry visible in her eyes. She focused deeply on her mana and moved out of the way once more trying to find an opportunity to strike back. In the corner of her eye, she saw Winston was faring even worse than her. He and Katamu were trading blows against one another in quick succession, defending and attacking without a break although Winston seemed to be more on the defensive than Katamu. Blood coated his torso although he grit his teeth and kept on punching. 

“I’m your opponent!” Aura reminded Bianca as her fist came swinging towards the girl although Bianca reinforced her forearm, deflecting the attack and sliding into Aura before hitting her with a heavily reinforced fist, right to the chest. Aura’s legs crumpled slightly as she moved away giving a thumbs up. She was too winded to speak but it was a clear sign of Bianca passing her test. 

The next morning she’d head over to the courtyard and see Winston and Katamu still going at it. Their movements had slowed down much more than before but it seemed like Winston had more fight left in him, he was however in a much worse state. Now it was down to who could endure more. Bianca sat down, closing her eyes and waiting for Winston to either win or lose. It truly was a sadistic battle of attrition. Bianca was slightly shocked Luna didn’t stop it sooner although they were probably in the stage where if you struggle here, you aren’t cut out to be a hunter. After some time passed Bianca would open her eyes seeing Winston and Katamu STILL going at it. She felt an ache in her chest, it hurt her to see Winston going through what must be an insane amount of pain but the determination in his eyes struck her the most; It was like he wasn’t going down until he said he wanted to go down. Eventually, the battle drew to a close with both fists landing at the same time. The man and boy fell to the ground simultaneously, both having reached the end of their tether. Bianca looked up eagerly at Luna who nodded to indicate Winston had passed before Bianca rushed over and hugged the unconscious lad. 

“Well done, Winston.” She whispered in his ear before carrying him to try and find Aura to help heal him.

“Huh, so they really both fell simultaneously?” Aura muttered as she held her hand over both Winston’s and Katamu’s wounds. Her hands glowed a small green as she seemed to focus her mana directly on the injuries. 

“Yes!” Bianca nodded eagerly, “That must put us way higher than F-rank then right?”

“...No.” Aura smiled lightly, “We got heavily restricted in your test. Luna wanted you to think you were in a situation where you were basically fighting for your spot in the team but in reality, it was to test if you had really practised and understood what she was saying in the lessons.” She shrugged as Bianca seemed a little deflated, “Winston did however put up a rather good fight I’ll give him that.” Aura stood up, dusting her hands off, “All done now, they just need a little rest.”

“Thank you,” Bianca replied as she sat by Winston’s side, “Could I ask you a question? Or well two?” She asked, her eyes brimmed with curiosity.

“Shoot.”

“What exactly do you mean by heavily restricted? Did you have to hold back or something?”

“Yeah basically, that said I guess our endurance wouldn’t have exactly been as restricted as our strength. That aside though, we are generally restricted as Nephilim. In Alchante* and Earth we won’t be at full power in order to limit our effect on the world, after all, Angels are pretty bloody strong. Typically we’re only at a rather small fraction of our actual power, Captains even less. The only time we aren’t is if we receive Grace. Grace basically lifts all our inflicted restrictions but it is incredibly rare to achieve as it comes from the Divine One Themself. We do however have a ‘man-made’ version of Grace which you will learn in time enough. It’s nowhere near as effective as Grace itself but it does get the job done quite often.” Aura explained somewhat happy to talk about it, “That said, not everyone achieves this version of Grace. It’s considered a huge milestone and takes traditional Nephilim 20 years to properly use. I won’t spoil too much now though, I’m sure Lieutenant Luna will tell you about it when the time comes.”

“I see, thank you. My other question is how are you able to heal?”

“Well you see Mana, it’s sort of seen as positive energy. What I do is reverse that energy which enables me to heal both myself and others since I’m very adept at it. A very hard skill to pick up which is why healers are rather rare and have their own Section. One thing though is all high-level Demons naturally have the ability to heal, whether they understand how Mana works or it’s just instinctive is another thing. It’s why Gallion is a heavily sought-after ore in the hunter business, it sort of prevents demons from healing in the short term which makes our lives much easier.”

“Wait does that-” Bianca was cut off as Winston gave a loud yawn, sitting up with a stretch whilst rubbing his eyes.

“Did I win?” He asked, looking at Bianca, his vision still slightly blurry. She nodded and shuffled closer to him.

“You did, well done.” She grinned rubbing his hair as Aura left the room somewhat awkwardly. 

“Superb.” Winston replied with a rather proud smile, “I’m sure Zenon will be pleased to see how far we’ve progressed!”

“For sure, for once he actually needs us.” Bianca said with a smug grin, “We’ve definitely surpassed him.”

“I wouldn’t be so sure of that.” A familiar voice said from the doorway, Archon stood there with a grim look on his face.

*Alchante is not in the same world as Earth, in their lessons the Duo of Winston and Bianca learnt that it’s actually a separate dimension. The map of it on Earth shows the most commonly used Gate to access it but mini gates can be opened by Lieutenants and above anywhere in the world.
