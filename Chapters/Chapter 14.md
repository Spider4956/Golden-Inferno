# Chapter 14

After getting used to their new home, Winston and Bianca ventured out, following the path that Archon told them to. They were both constantly in awe of what surrounded them - it didn’t look real. Definitely not something normal humans would be able to build. Eventually, they got to a blossom tree with a pond and rather large building. In the courtyard there were people in black uniforms, sparring with one another. Nervously, the two walked up to the main door and knocked.

“Come in.” Archon said as they slid the door open and entered. The room was quite plain aside from the weapons hanging up on the wall in glass cases. Archon was kneeling on the floor in the middle with a woman by his side. She wore glasses and had silky black hair plaited into a single tail. She wore black robes instead of the white that Archon wore but she had a special marking on her shoulder.

“I’ll come back later, Captain Archon.” She said her voice was warm like caramel. She stood up and left the room, closing the door behind her.

“See you later Lieutenant Luna.” Archon would look up to Bianca and Winston, “Please do, take a seat.” he said, indicating for them to sit down. They took his offer as he began to talk, “I’m sure you have many questions about Alchante and all. I guess the best thing would be to explain the system to you and the guilds.” He cleared his throat slightly, “As you know, you can become a hunter. Once you get your licence you can join a guild. There are five major ones each with slightly different sub-goals although they all have something in common. Their main aim is to eradicate demons. The guild that headquarters in Alchante and the one I am part of is the Royal Hunters Guild. We directly serve the king of Alchante and mostly consist of Nephilim. Human and Angel hybrids, don’t ask how that works. Better you don’t know.” He smiled innocently, “Of course I understand that neither of you are Nephilim, unless you are?” He looked a bit excited although they shook their heads, “Yeah I thought so. Despite that, you made it to Alchante by yourselves so I would like to offer you a place among the Royal Hunters, more specifically within the 2nd division.” He paused waiting for their answer.

“What about Zen-” Bianca began before Winston cut her off.

“We accept.” Winston smiled. “Probably the best offer seeing how hard it was to get here. Also considering that most of you are half angels?!? Like are we going to gloss over that fact?” He asked somewhat energetically to which Archon shrugged.

“Winston James Daichi and Bianca Talia Izumi, you are now Royal Hunters. As such, you will have some classes to attend so you can learn about everything!” Archon grinned to which they sighed.

“Pretty sure we became hunters to avoid school.” Bianca muttered.

“That’s a good point, you guys do look pretty young.”

“I’m 15.” Winston said, puffing his chest out.

“I’m 14.” Bianca shrugged, “Zenon is also 14 I’d hazard a guess.”

“Yes well Zenon…” Archon began.

“We’re saving him.” Bianca interjected to which Archon smiled warmly.

“There’s no need for you to risk your lives to save him. Now that you’re officially members of Squad 2 I can let you in on a little secret,” He winked, “I won’t be letting Zenon’s execution go ahead. After all, you can’t execute someone who isn’t there. Keep it hush hush though, otherwise we’ll get executed. For now just focus on your training, I plan on making you fully fledged Anchisukiru’s as soon as possible.”

Archon entered the chamber Zenon was being held alone and walked up to the boy. He’d then sit down cross-legged in front of Zenon, holding out some Ambrosia to him.

“Your friend’s are very bent on saving you.” Archon smiled, “So am I. The superior’s are just scared of you.”

“Many people were. That’s why I couldn’t live among humans when I was younger.” Zenon sighed before taking a sip of Ambrosia with the very restricted movement he had. “I’ve learnt to suppress it as much as possible.”

“You aren’t suppressing the demon Zenon. You’re suppressing your mana. That’s how you’ve remained undetected for the past 14 years.” Archon surveyed Zenon’s confused expression. “Mana is-”

“The energy that exists within everyone, whether they’re a soul, hunter, demon or human.” Luna said pointing at the diagram behind her to a class of hunters. Winston looked barely awake whilst Bianca was scribbling down notes enthusiastically, “Typically everyone’s mana varies to a large degree. As of current I’d hazard that you all have low amounts of mana within you. It’s pretty simple to increase your mana. Using it more often and constantly suppressing it over time are ways to help boost it but there’s also more focused training and meditation you can do. One of the reasons why Lieutenants and Captains have stupidly large reserves of mana is due to their long life. Forgive me for saying this but Captain Archon himself is in the quadruple digits regarding age. He is an outlier though, most Captains are around 500 years of age.” She smiled as she walked around, “Seeing as you’re new to mana the first aim of this class will be to get you to identify it. Focus on within, if you concentrate hard enough you should be able to feel something flowing around you. Catch onto it and don’t let it go.”

“You’re already quite adept with mana, more so than you believe Zenon.” Archon continued, “You’ve been reflexively using it more than you think in your day to day life.” He laughed, “You truly are remarkable, already having the basics mastered. It means we can skip straight to the-”

“Fun stuff only begins once you are able to control your mana without thinking.” Luna would tap Winston with a wooden sword and he leapt back, “You’re focussing way too deeply. You don’t wanna be in a state where you completely ignore everything else.” She remarked as she walked around. “Eventually it should feel natural.”

Winston collapsed on his mat, sweat dripping from his head.

“Information overload.” He groaned as he rolled his on back, “Way too much stuff. I just wanna do some cool magic stuff, I don’t care about the origination of magic and all this small mana stuff. Let me control some kind of element or something!”

“Well Lieutenant Luna did say that once we master the basics we can do more.” Bianca said in a matter-of-fact tone, “Didn’t you hear about how old everyone here is? They’ve had ages to master it. We’re only human and we’ll probably die of old age before even reaching the sort of things they’re getting at.” She sat down on her mat, “It’s weird though, this whole place feels sort of elitist.. When I dreamed of becoming a hunter I never thought of being in a guild as advanced as this.” She commented, “It also feels so traditional compared to the South.” She paused, “No, compared to the real world.” Winston gave her a weird look. “Haven’t you noticed? We aren’t on Earth anymore. It’s weird but it’s like we’re in another dimension layered on top of the normal one?” She held up a book, “I did some pre-reading. The history of Alchante is pretty interesting.”

“Yeah I think I’ll pass.” Winston said standing up, “Let’s go see Zenon!” He suggested with a grin.

“We can’t,” Bianca said somewhat crestfallen, “If you read you’ll see the place he’s being held is one of the strongest forms of security. The chains he has suppresses his mana and the room itself is basically indestructible. Not even gallion can damage it and that’s meant to be indestructible itself! Only Captains have access to it and I’m sure Archon is busy right now.” She murmured. “Let’s just focus on our training like he said, we’ll see him eventually.”

The lessons continued on as normal, a mix between history and mana control. All of the trainees were now wearing the same black uniform as everyone else and seemed to be getting settled into the routine of life as an Anchisukiru. They finally moved off the boring meditation of focussing on mana and seemed to be having a more practical use. Now outside, the rookies were laying into straw dummies with mana coated hands. Each hit had a resounding feeling behind it although Bianca’s dummy seemed to be the most hurt out of them all. Like she had a personal vendetta against it.

“Now in pairs try to fight.” Archon would say suddenly appearing amongst the trainees who all straightened up in respect, “One person will infuse mana in their attacks whilst the other will use mana to defend against the hits, alternating between the two. Try to guide your mana to the exact point of the hit or else you will be exhausted quickly. Good luck! Winner is the person still standing at the end.” He would disappear once more and Luna adjusted her glasses not as taken aback as everyone else.

“You’ll get used to him doing that eventually. Now, as he says!” she said. Bianca and Winston would circle each other, their mana floating around them. Bianca launched first, swinging her arm and punching Winston in the shoulder although nothing happened, he didn’t even stagger. Rather Bianca would wince and back away as Winston swung round punching Bianca. She stumbled slightly although it didn’t really hurt. Luna smirked slightly as she watched them, it was clear that Winston lacked punch but his defence was almost impenetrable whereas Bianca’s punch had too much power behind it. If they were against anyone else, their opponent would be out incredibly fast. Unstoppable force vs immovable object was the best way to describe it.

“Now Zenon,” Archon would begin, “I know the chains are restricting you tremendously but I think it would be best if you learnt magic before we broke you out. If the worst comes to worse I’d rather not have you instantly blitzed by another captain. I know some who really want you dead.”

“What do I have to do?” Zenon asked, his eyes focussed deeply on Archon, he found it really helpful how often Archon came. He knew there wasn’t much that could be done outside of what they were doing now.

“Your ‘powers’ actually come from a being within you. A sort of spirit that materialises as a visible portrayal of your manner. You basically need to connect to your spirit world and ask them what your power is, if they tell you, then you're good as gold, although everyone’s spirit, otherwise known as Manaki, are different. Some give it to you with no questions asked, others are a bit more difficult. Unfortunately, due to your restraints we’re gonna have to be a bit unorthodox about this.” Archon gave a wry grin, “Good luck.” He pulled out a silver sword with odd markings yet Zenon didn't have much time to analyse it before he felt a blow to his head.
